# front-end-challenge
Model management front end challenge

Installation & Setup Instruction

As json-server can not serve react files out of the box,
I created another react based server, ( have shared the code)
to run in local, the command is: "npm run start"

this will run react server on http://localhost:3001

which connects with json-server running on http://localhost:3000


and for demo server, I have deployed the json server on https://app5m2.herokuapp.com/
and react's build files are deployed on http://model-poc.clients.login2tech.org/
